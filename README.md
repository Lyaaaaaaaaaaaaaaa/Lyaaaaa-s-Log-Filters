# Lyaaaaa-s-Log-Filters

## What does this project do?
This project is a lightweight user-friendly software which filters logs. You give him a log file and filters and it displays you the lines in which appears your filters.

## Why is this project useful?
It is more efficient and more readable for sizeable files. Ctrl+f is limited when you need a clear and readable output. Moreover, this project accepts multiple filters.
In addition, in gaming communities, it's important for servers staff to monitor the logs. However, everyone has not knowledge in Linux/Windows terminal. The software comes with a simple interface usable by anyone.

## Project roadmap:
1. Creating the package to read a file, filter it, and return each 'correct' line. *Working*
2. Create an interface.  *Done*
3. Connect the interface to the previous package. *WIP*
