CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your consideration in contributing to my humble project! It's very kind. However, be sure to read the code of conduct before to contributing.

How to suggest a new feature?
Go in issues, then click on new issue and select Feature request. Any suggestion is welcome! Of course, everything isn't possible but giving your opinion or thought about improving this project is helpful.
How to set up your environment and run tests?

You will need an Ada compiler to compile the code. Otherwise, you can use any text editor. I personally use Gnat IDE. To run the interface you will require GTKAda

The types of contributions I'm looking for?
I'm looking for contributions of any kind. As long as you feel it is useful to contribute, do so! You can contribute by making some doc (Once the project is advanced enough to have need of a doc), giving some design advice or even suggestions. Of course, someone with experience in Ada programming or GTK is highly appreciated also :).
